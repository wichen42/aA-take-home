Welcome to a/A's takehome frontend challenge, Ann loves coffee, so, we're going to make her a coffee blog! You know they say that caffine is the lifeblood of a software engineer. We will need a frontend to go with that backend for Ann's Coffee! we're going for more of minimalist design this time.

A quick look at what it will look like, 


We will need two modals, one to create posts: 
and another to add new coffees:
(Caffine percentage will need to be calculated by us! Remember it's the percentage of caffine in 1 oz of that coffee) 

As seen in the first gif, you should be able to sort the post by date asc or desc. both posts and coffee should be able to handle cases where there is enough data to fill the page. Feel free to expand upon the style as long as it matches. You will be able to find the svgs you need in the asset folder.

Bonus: Wouldn't it be cool if we could also sort posts by coffee? If you made that api route why not add it yourself to the project?
